# Loan-Payment-Prediction-Project

For this project I'll be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. 
Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). 
As an investor one wants to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying back.
The Loan Payemnt Predictor aims to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full using lending data.
The project comprises of two Machine Learning alogrithms: Decision Trees & Random Forest Classifier
Both the algorithms are leveraged to classify and predict
The results have been compared to find out the most efficient algorithm for this use case!

P.S. Be sure to check out to an interesting result at the end.
